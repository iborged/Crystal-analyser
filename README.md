# Crystal-analyser

This code written in Fortran 90 analyzes the following characteristics of Mo2C cubic structures:

1. Quantify the number of neighbors that each molybdenun atom has.
2. Quantify the average deviation of the bond-valence of molybdenum atoms.
3. Quantify the number of sub-units of C-Mo-C with a geometry of 180 degrees.
